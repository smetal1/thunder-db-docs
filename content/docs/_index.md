Welcome to the ThunderDB documentation. Whether you are a **Developer** building applications,
an **Administrator** managing deployments, or a **Contributor** improving ThunderDB itself,
you will find comprehensive guides here.

## Who Is This Documentation For?

### Developers

Build applications on ThunderDB using familiar SQL, multiple wire protocols (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis),
REST/gRPC/GraphQL APIs, and native vector search. Start with the [Getting Started](getting-started/) guide,
explore the [SQL Reference](developer/sql-reference/), and browse [Examples](developer/examples/).

### Administrators

Deploy, configure, monitor, and secure ThunderDB in production environments.
See [Deployment](administrator/deployment/) for installation options,
[Configuration](administrator/configuration/) for tuning,
and [Monitoring](administrator/monitoring/) for observability.

### Contributors

Contribute to ThunderDB development. Learn the [Codebase Structure](contributor/codebase-guide/),
set up your [Development Environment](contributor/development-setup/),
and understand the [Testing](contributor/testing/) and [Release](contributor/release-process/) workflows.
